# Beam 3rd Gen Project
 BEAM 3rd Gen is a team formed in Thessaloniki from undergraduate students passionate about space missions. Our team was created in August 2020. We aim to participate in a number of educational space-related programs, the main being the REXUS-BEXUS competition. Our project for the REXUS competition, named DROPSTAR deals with the behavior of emulsions in microgravity.
