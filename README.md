# Beam 3rd Gen Project

We are BEAM 3rd Gen, one of BEAMâ€™s teams, that consist of students from various fields of study, who share their love for space missions.
Our team was created in August 2020.
We are currently working on our main project, DROPSTAR, which is a microgravity experiment that will be launched in a sounding rocket in 2024.
This project is part of the REXUS/BEXUS programme, an educational competition organized by ESA, DLR, SNSA, SSC, ZARM and EUROLAUNCH.
