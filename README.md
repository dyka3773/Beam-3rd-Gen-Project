> **Note:** All the data presented in the GUI is fake. In order to have real data, I need to have an CSV generated by something (preferably the real connection to the experiment).
### TODOs/Extras

- [X] Find out why the info box is not presented in the GUI
- [X] Find a way to call the `figures` endpoint from the GUI to replace images
- [X] Complete the Downlink page

- [X] Create pages for the Test plans 
- [ ] Create page for the Uplink
- [X] Add a button that deletes the data on the rocket-side
- [ ] Generate the CSV file with fake data but in real time with the proper format
