# This is DROPSTAR's Ground Station Software

> **Note:** All the data presented in the GUI is fake. In order to have real data, I need to have an CSV generated by something (preferably the real connection to the experiment).
### TODOs/Extras

- [ ] Update info box with the latest information
- [ ] Create page for the Uplink
- [ ] During testing again the downlink data, there is an issue with multiple requests and the db locking the file
- [X] Generate the CSV file with fake data but in real time with the proper format
