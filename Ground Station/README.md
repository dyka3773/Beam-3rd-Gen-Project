# This is DROPSTAR's Ground Station Software

> **Note:** All the data presented in the GUI is fake. In order to have real data, I need to have an CSV generated by something (preferably the real connection to the experiment).
### TODOs/Extras

- [ ] Update info box with the latest information
- [ ] Create page for the Uplink
- [ ] During testing again the downlink data, there is an issue with multiple requests and the db locking the file
- [ ] Decouple the info section so that it presents the same data everywhere without having to copy paste the code
- [ ] Write a Markdown file on how to use the software in the prespective of someone who has never used it before
